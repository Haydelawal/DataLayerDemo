# Key Take Away

Welcome to the Dummy Data Layer Demo Android app project! 

## This project was designed for demo purposes only, to show how to collect data from the following:

1. **collect and display data from room db via ui**:
2. **collect data from room db via ui already populated room db**:
3. **collect data from room db and api via ui from paging library**:
4. **collect data from url using retrofit**:

## It doesn't fully implement some best practices such as full ui impl, error handling, retry logic, and others as you see fit
## you will need an unsplash api key to get the paging aspect to work, as i didn't commit my api key

## lastly the type of modularization used in this project was implemented with plug and play in mind..
# this means you can easily run each module separately and independently of other modules...
# this modularization wont be ideal in a real world scenario but properly modularizing this project would be overkill


``` There you have it folks, feel free to extend this as you like and may the force be with you!
